      "contents": "\nI think you need to listen to your wife more, and anti-government\npodcasters less, personally.\nThere is a group of people who want to give a nice little packaged\nstory:\nChina manufactured the virus, it got “out” of the lab into Wuhan, and\nspread around the world. And it’s been worldwide since Sept - Nov 2019,\nnot Jan - Feb 2020. The pharmaceutical companies rushed a vaccine and\nfudged all the data to get it approved, but it doesn’t really work. And\nwe can’t tell how it really works because it’s “experimental”, to\nboot.\nIn addition, the numbers of patients dying from COVID are really a\nlot lower, and are being inflated by coroners to keep people scared.\nThere are simple remedies to COVID, Ivermectin, Hydrochloroquine,\nVitamin C, that big pharma and the government don’t want you to know\nabout because then that would hurt pharmas profits. And the mRNA vaccine\ntech has been around since the 1990’s, but it doesn’t work that well, or\nit’s actually going to make things worse.\nThis is all a load of bullshit. Yes, bullshit.\nThey want you to trust no one, and possibly actually believe all of\nthis. Anti-scientism became popular for two major reasons: 1 - the MMR\nvaccine and autism link, which was shown to be a completely made up\nfraud; and 2 - big oil companies paying “experts” to throw suspicion on\nglobal warming / climate change researchers to keep governments from\ngetting too nosy and hurting their bottom line. Subsequently, a lot of\npeople got into that, and it’s become really popular. I’m sure there are\na lot of really sincere people who believe that COVID and global warming\nare a hoax, or that you can’t trust anyone in government or pharma.\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study\nYes, I’m lumping global warming / climate change in here. Shell and\nEnron scientists KNEW in the 80’s that CO2 emissions would likely cause\na greenhouse effect, and actually predicted the increase in global\ntemperatures we see today. But executives went ahead and didn’t do a\nthing about it. And now we are in this mess.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings\nhttps://xkcd.com/2500/\nNow, are there issues with pharmaceutical companies. Heck yes! What\nhappened with Oxycontin for example is completely crazy.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/business-54636002\nWhat others have done in the name of profits is also just not cool.\nAnd government is a buracracy, and you have representatives who go on to\nlobby for industries, or work for companies that need government\nregulation. That’s not cool either. But we must remember we live in a\nsin filled world, and many people are looking out for themselves. Our\nsociety seems to have lost the idea of a “common good”.\nhttps://represent.us/action/5-facts-lobbyists/\nAnyway. New viruses are expected to happen all the time due to\nmutation and exposures between animals and people. Again, we’ve been\nwarned by scientists that a new pandemic was coming, and had relatively\nmild tastes of that back with SARS and MERS. There was actually a\nsurveillance effort started, and one of the bases was in China. And\nthere was a pandemic response playbook sitting in a White House office,\nthat officials there chose to ignore. Luckily those didn’t replicate\nfast enough, or weren’t transmissable enough compared to COVID-19. And\nthis time, we didn’t get so lucky.\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/scientists-predicted-coronavirus-pandemic/613003/\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285\nSo, the vaccines. It sounds like Robert Malone was involved in mRNA\nresearch in the late 80’s early 90’s. Cool. Doesn’t mean he invented\nmRNA vaccines. David Pogue has a really, really excellent podcast\nepisode on what it took to figure out HOW to make an mRNA vaccine\nviable.\nModerna was actually in the process of testing mRNA vaccines for\nother diseases when COVID struck, and they were able to roll out\nsomething very quickly. But the scientists who actually figured it out,\nthey toiled for years, and years to get it to work. Much of that was\nunfunded work, because they believed in the concept so much.\nhttps://unsungscience.com/the-podcast/season-1/mrna-vaccine/\nhttps://www.modernatx.com/pipeline?\nThe world government (and USA in particular) threw a lot of money at\nthe pharmaceutical companies to help make the vaccine happen, and make\nsure they were safe enough and effective. Studies that normally took\nyears happened in months, yes. But the numbers of people studied were\nquite impressive. And at least in the US, they have only passed the\n“Emergency Use Authorization”. Which means that there is enough evidence\nthat they work, but not years of study normally required for vaccine.\nGuess what? That same authorization is what is used for the tests, too.\nBut it doesn’t mean it’s “experimental”.\nAnd then there is masks in there too. Back in the 1930’s someone used\nparticular terms for transmission of Tuberculosis that implied most\ndiseases shouldn’t be that spreadable by merely “talking” or spending a\nlot of time in the same room as someone who was infected but wasn’t\n“coughing”. Until COVID, there wasn’t a lot of modern research on just\nhow transmissable a disease was through the air. It was all “settled” in\nthe 1930’s, right? It took a lot of work for that to get figured out,\nand even the researchers who were doing droplet research to get\npublished. Now, everyone is seeing how scientific research happens\nalmost in “real time”, with new evidence and new recommendations. It\ndoesn’t mean science is broken, that’s how science happens.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293495/\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/\nIt also means anyone can write a paper, like the initial\nHydroxychloroquine study, do some cherry picked statistics, and put it\nout there to make a name for themselves. Again, there are scientists who\ndon’t really care who they put in harms way, and will write up anything\nto make a name for themself. Or more likely, have a prior belief that\nsomething works, and instead of believing that statistics that say it\ndoesn’t work, instead cherry pick variables / patients, or manufacture\ndata to make it looks like it works.\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/\nFinally, I follow a lot of the people tracking excess mortality (one\nway to estimate the true effects of COVID), and their data seems rather\nlegit. I believe the numbers of people who have died directly from COVID\nare much higher than official reports. The recent surge from Omicron has\nme pretty scared, frankly.\n\n\n",
