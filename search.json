      "contents": "\nI think you need to listen to your wife more, and anti-government podcasters less, personally.\nThere is a group of people who want to give a nice little packaged story:\nChina manufactured the virus, it got “out” of the lab into Wuhan, and spread around the world. And it’s been worldwide since Sept - Nov 2019, not Jan - Feb 2020. The pharmaceutical companies rushed a vaccine and fudged all the data to get it approved, but it doesn’t really work. And we can’t tell how it really works because it’s “experimental”, to boot.\nIn addition, the numbers of patients dying from COVID are really a lot lower, and are being inflated by coroners to keep people scared. There are simple remedies to COVID, Ivermectin, Hydrochloroquine, Vitamin C, that big pharma and the government don’t want you to know about because then that would hurt pharmas profits. And the mRNA vaccine tech has been around since the 1990’s, but it doesn’t work that well, or it’s actually going to make things worse.\nThis is all a load of bullshit. Yes, bullshit.\nThey want you to trust no one, and possibly actually believe all of this. Anti-scientism became popular for two major reasons: 1 - the MMR vaccine and autism link, which was shown to be a completely made up fraud; and 2 - big oil companies paying “experts” to throw suspicion on global warming / climate change researchers to keep governments from getting too nosy and hurting their bottom line. Subsequently, a lot of people got into that, and it’s become really popular. I’m sure there are a lot of really sincere people who believe that COVID and global warming are a hoax, or that you can’t trust anyone in government or pharma.\nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study\nYes, I’m lumping global warming / climate change in here. Shell and Enron scientists KNEW in the 80’s that CO2 emissions would likely cause a greenhouse effect, and actually predicted the increase in global temperatures we see today. But executives went ahead and didn’t do a thing about it. And now we are in this mess.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings\nhttps://xkcd.com/2500/\nNow, are there issues with pharmaceutical companies. Heck yes! What happened with Oxycontin for example is completely crazy.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/business-54636002\nWhat others have done in the name of profits is also just not cool. And government is a buracracy, and you have representatives who go on to lobby for industries, or work for companies that need government regulation. That’s not cool either. But we must remember we live in a sin filled world, and many people are looking out for themselves. Our society seems to have lost the idea of a “common good”.\nhttps://represent.us/action/5-facts-lobbyists/\nAnyway. New viruses are expected to happen all the time due to mutation and exposures between animals and people. Again, we’ve been warned by scientists that a new pandemic was coming, and had relatively mild tastes of that back with SARS and MERS. There was actually a surveillance effort started, and one of the bases was in China. And there was a pandemic response playbook sitting in a White House office, that officials there chose to ignore. Luckily those didn’t replicate fast enough, or weren’t transmissable enough compared to COVID-19. And this time, we didn’t get so lucky.\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/scientists-predicted-coronavirus-pandemic/613003/\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285\nSo, the vaccines. It sounds like Robert Malone was involved in mRNA research in the late 80’s early 90’s. Cool. Doesn’t mean he invented mRNA vaccines. David Pogue has a really, really excellent podcast episode on what it took to figure out HOW to make an mRNA vaccine viable.\nModerna was actually in the process of testing mRNA vaccines for other diseases when COVID struck, and they were able to roll out something very quickly. But the scientists who actually figured it out, they toiled for years, and years to get it to work. Much of that was unfunded work, because they believed in the concept so much.\nhttps://unsungscience.com/the-podcast/season-1/mrna-vaccine/\nhttps://www.modernatx.com/pipeline?\nThe world government (and USA in particular) threw a lot of money at the pharmaceutical companies to help make the vaccine happen, and make sure they were safe enough and effective. Studies that normally took years happened in months, yes. But the numbers of people studied were quite impressive. And at least in the US, they have only passed the “Emergency Use Authorization”. Which means that there is enough evidence that they work, but not years of study normally required for vaccine. Guess what? That same authorization is what is used for the tests, too. But it doesn’t mean it’s “experimental”.\nAnd then there is masks in there too. Back in the 1930’s someone used particular terms for transmission of Tuberculosis that implied most diseases shouldn’t be that spreadable by merely “talking” or spending a lot of time in the same room as someone who was infected but wasn’t “coughing”. Until COVID, there wasn’t a lot of modern research on just how transmissable a disease was through the air. It was all “settled” in the 1930’s, right?\nIt took a lot of work for that to get figured out, and even the researchers who were doing droplet research to get published. Now, everyone is seeing how scientific research happens almost in “real time”, with new evidence and new recommendations. It doesn’t mean science is broken, that’s how science happens.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293495/\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/\nIt also means anyone can write a paper, like the initial Hydroxychloroquine study, do some cherry picked statistics, and put it out there to make a name for themselves. Again, there are scientists who don’t really care who they put in harms way, and will write up anything to make a name for themself. Or more likely, have a prior belief that something works, and instead of believing that statistics that say it doesn’t work, instead cherry pick variables / patients, or manufacture data to make it looks like it works.\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/\nFinally, I follow a lot of the people tracking excess mortality (one way to estimate the true effects of COVID), and their data seems rather legit. I believe the numbers of people who have died directly from COVID are much higher than official reports. The recent surge from Omicron has me pretty scared, frankly.\n\n\n",
