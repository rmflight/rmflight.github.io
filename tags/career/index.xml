      <description>TL;DR I don’t want to be a PI because I enjoy spending time with my family, and don’t think I can handle the stress of juggling multiple grants, people, and deadlines. I want to be a staff member in a group that affords relative autonomy, while providing some security. If I’m lucky enough, my current position will enable that.
 The Bad News If you keep up with the news in academia, this is a horrible time to be a postdoc (post-doctoral) or PI (principal investigator).</description>
