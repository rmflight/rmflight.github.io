      <description>What? For those who donâ€™t know, CDF files are chip definition format files that define which probes belong to which probesets, and are necessary to use any of the standard summarization methods such as RMA, and others.
 Why? Because we can, and because custom definitions have been shown to be quite useful. See the information over at Brainarray.
 Why not somewhere else? A lot of times other people create custom CDF files based on their own criteria, and make it subsequently available for others to use (see the Brainarray for an example of what some are doing, as well as PlandbAffy)</description>
