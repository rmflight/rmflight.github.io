      <description>I have noted at least one instance (and there are probably others) about how Python’s docStrings are so great, and wouldn’t it be nice to have a similar system in R. Especially when you can have your new function tab completion available depending on your development environment.
This is a false statement, however. If you set up your R development environment properly, you can have these features available in R.</description>
