      <description>University of Kentucky (UK) recently partnered with the discovery portal KNODE, for helping others to discover potential collaborators at UK. KNODE looks like a large corporate venture, that is probably costing a large amount of capital to the university (and other places that use it). I wonder if the universities money would be better spent on encouraging submission of preprints, a Github Enterprise/Education package and teaching researchers and faculty how to use social media like twitter.</description>
