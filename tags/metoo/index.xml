      <description>TL;DR With the recent charges of sexual harassment against some high-profile individuals, and so many women coming forward with #metoo (and the understanding that this is really something almost all women have faced), I realized that my younger self was #partoftheproblem. I think many other men are part of the problem, even though they might not think so. I didnâ€™t think I was part of the problem either. I hope that other men might read this and critically evaluate if they are #partoftheproblem.</description>
