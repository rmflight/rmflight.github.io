      <description>Kaitlin Thaney asked on Twitter last week about using Ramnath Vaidyanathan’s new interactive R notebook 1 2 for teaching.
Now, to be clear up front, I am not trying to be mean to Ramnath, discredit his work, or the effort that went into that project. I think it is really cool, and has some rather interesting potential applications, but I don’t really think it is the right interface for teaching R.</description>
