      <description>A blog post on the Weecology group blog by Elita Baldridge on being a PhD student with fibromyalgia, and how they are working through that, caused me to pause and reflect on my experience as a PhD student and PostDoc with migraines. For those who havenâ€™t read my blog, I do research in bioinformatics, specifically in transcriptomics and metabolomics. I spend almost all of my research hours in front of a computer writing code, generating plots, and trying to make sense of -omics level data.</description>
