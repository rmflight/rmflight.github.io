  <h1>R</h1>

  

  
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/packages-vs-projecttemplate/">Packages vs ProjectTemplate</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      tl;dr Imposing a different structure than R packages for distributing R code is a bad idea, especially now that R package tools have gotten to the point where managing a package has become much easier.
 ProjectTemplate ?? My last two posts (1, 2) provided an argument and an example of why one should use R packages to contain analyses. They were partly motivated by trends I had seen in other areas, including the appearance of the package ProjectTemplate.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/r-job-notifications-using-twitter/">R Job Notifications Using Twitter</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      There has been some interesting activity about getting R to send a notification somehow when a long running job is completed. The most notable entries I have seen in this category are RPushBullet for web notifications and pingr for audio notifications.
Although RPushBullet looks really cool (and Dirk does great work), I wondered if there was a way to do this using a free service that I already had access to, namely twitter.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/categorycompare-paper-finally-out/">categoryCompare Paper Finally Out!</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I can finally say that the publication on my Bioconductor package categoryCompare is finally published in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology section of Frontiers in Genetics. This has been a long time coming, and I wanted to give some background on the inspiration and development of the method and software.
TL;DR The software package has been in development in one form or another since 2010, released to Bioconductor in summer 2012, and the publication has bounced around and been revised since spring of 2013, and it is finally available to you.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/self-written-function-help/">Self-Written Function Help</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I have noted at least one instance (and there are probably others) about how Python’s docStrings are so great, and wouldn’t it be nice to have a similar system in R. Especially when you can have your new function tab completion available depending on your development environment.
This is a false statement, however. If you set up your R development environment properly, you can have these features available in R. It will take a little bit of work, however.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/installing-matlab-vs-installing-r/">Installing MatLab vs Installing R</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I retweeted this a few days ago:
1. Open MATLAB for first time in a few years after using #rstats. 2. Site license doesn’t work right. 3. F*** MATLAB, I’ll try to do it in R
And as I have started the process of installing MatLab on my own machine because I want to translate a published MatLab package into R, I am reminded of how painful the process can be.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/package-version-increment-pre-and-post-commit-hooks/">Package Version Increment Pre- and Post-Commit Hooks</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      If you just want the hook scripts, check this gist. If you want to know some of the motivation behind writing them, and about the internals, then read on.
Package Version Incrementing A good practice to get into is incrementing the minor version number (i.e. going from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2) after each git commit when developing packages (this is recommended by the Bioconductor devs as well ). This makes it very easy to know what changes are in your currently installed version, and if you remembered to actually install the most recent version for testing.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/open-vs-closed-analysis-languages/">Open vs Closed Analysis Languages</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      TL;DR I think data scientists should choose to learn open languages such as R and python because they are open in the sense that anyone can obtain them, use them and modify them for free, and this has lead to large, robust groups of users, making it more likely that packages exist that you can use, and others can easily build on your own work.
 Why the debate? This was sparked by a comment on twitter suggesting that data scientists and analysts need to be polyglots, that they should know more than one programming language or analysis framework (the full conversation of tweets can be found here)
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/pre-calculating-large-tables-of-values/">Pre-Calculating Large Tables of Values</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I’m currently working on a project where we want to know, based on a euclidian distance measure, what is the probability that the value is a match to the another value. i.e. given an actual value, and a theoretical value from calculation, what is the probability that they are the same? This can be calculated using a chi-square distribution with one degree-of-freedom, easily enough by considering how much of the chi-cdf we are taking up.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/portable-peronal-packages/">Portable, Peronal Packages</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      ProgrammingR had an interesting post recently about keeping a set of R functions that are used often as a gist on Github, and sourceing that file at the beginning of R analysis scripts. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it does end up cluttering the user workspace, and there is no real documentation on the functions, and no good way to implement unit testing.
However, the best way to have sets of R functions is as a package, that can then be installed and loaded by anyone.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/r-rstudio-and-release-and-dev-bioconductor/">R, RStudio, and Release and Dev Bioconductor</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I have one Bioconductor package that I am currently responsible for. Each bi-annual release of Bioconductor requires testing and squashing errors, warnings and bugs in a given package. Doing this means being able to work with multiple versions of R and multiple versions of Bioconductor libraries on a single system (assuming that you do production work and development on the same machine, right?).
I really, really like RStudio as my working R environment, as some of you have read before.
