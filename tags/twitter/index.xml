      <description>There has been some interesting activity about getting R to send a notification somehow when a long running job is completed. The most notable entries I have seen in this category are RPushBullet for web notifications and pingr for audio notifications.
Although RPushBullet looks really cool (and Dirk does great work), I wondered if there was a way to do this using a free service that I already had access to, namely twitter.</description>
